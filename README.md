A GitHub Action that downloads and extracts build artifacts from an AWS S3 bucket, simplifying CI/CD workflows by automating artifact retrieval.

## üìå Overview

This action enables seamless integration of stored build artifacts into your CI/CD pipeline by fetching and extracting them from an S3 bucket.

## ‚ú® Features

- üîπ Automates artifact retrieval from AWS S3
- üîπ Secure authentication using AWS credentials
- üîπ Extracts the artifact to a specified directory
- üîπ Cleans up after extraction for optimized workflows

## üöÄ Usage

To use this action in your GitHub workflow, add the following step to your `workflow.yml`:

```yaml
- name: Download and Extract Build Artifact
  uses: anilrajrimal1/artifact-downloader@v1.0.0
  with:
    aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
    aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
    aws-region: ${{ env.AWS_REGION }}
    project-name: ${{ env.PROJECT_NAME }}
    s3-base-path: "s3://your-bucket-name"
    target-directory: "."
```

## üîß Inputs

| Name                   | Required | Default      | Description                                     |
|------------------------|----------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `aws-access-key-id`    | ‚úÖ Yes   | -            | AWS access key ID for authentication           |
| `aws-secret-access-key`| ‚úÖ Yes   | -            | AWS secret access key for authentication       |
| `aws-region`          | ‚úÖ Yes   | `ap-south-1` | AWS region where the S3 bucket is located      |
| `project-name`        | ‚úÖ Yes   | -            | Project name used for identifying artifacts    |
| `s3-base-path`        | ‚úÖ Yes   | -            | Base S3 path where artifacts are stored       |
| `target-directory`    | ‚ùå No    | `.`          | Directory to extract the artifact             |

## üîÑ How It Works

1. Configures AWS credentials securely.
2. Downloads the artifact ZIP file from the specified S3 path.
3. Extracts the ZIP file to the given `target-directory`.
4. Cleans up the downloaded ZIP file after extraction.

## Security Notes

- Store your `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` as GitHub Secrets.
- Never hardcode sensitive credentials in workflow files.
- Uses AWS best practices for secure authentication.

## Requirements

- GitHub Actions runner with AWS CLI installed.
- An AWS Credentials with proper access to S3
